# Building-and-Securing-a-Small-Network
This project demonstrates a small network with VLANs for segmentation, trunking for inter-switch communication, and Router-on-a-Stick for inter-VLAN routing. ACLs are implemented to control traffic between VLANs. Configurations for both the router and switch are included, along with detailed project documentation.
